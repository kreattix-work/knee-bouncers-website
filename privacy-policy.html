          <p>
            Welcome to KneeBouncers.com (KneeBouncers), which is owned and
            operated by KneeBouncers, LLC. We promote play with purpose. We
            believe that through play, little ones can creatively explore and
            discover their world and develop a life long love of learning. We
            provide interactive learning and development play designed with
            early education experts to provide premium age-appropriate content.
            Our mission is to engage, encourage, entertain and educate in a safe
            online environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which KneeBouncers, and
            its subsidiaries (collectively, we, our, us, or the Company)
            collect, use, and disclose information about you and the children
            who use your Account through KneeBouncers, and any other websites,
            applications, and online services (Apps) that link to this policy.
            Our Services are directed towards babies, toddlers, and preschool
            children. Please read this Privacy Policy closely. By using the
            Services, you agree to the handling of your information in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy. Summary of Key Points You
            should read this entire Privacy Policy and also our Terms &
            Conditions, but here are some key points:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Services are backed by our Child Safe guarantee. This means
              that Accounts will never include any pop-up ads or other
              advertisements directed to children.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal Information, or PI, is defined in this policy to mirror
              the text of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and means
              information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of
              being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
              indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
            </li>
            <li>
              We take your privacy very seriously, and we never monetize your
              Personal Information; we use it to enhance your experience with
              opportunities like special promotions and offers.
            </li>
            <li>
              During KneeBouncers registration, the only information we may ask
              you to provide is related to the parent, guardian, teacher, or
              adult who is responsible for the account.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information we collect is information you provide (such as
              first name, age, city and state) and will not be shared with a
              third party. For example, when you search for or buy a product or
              service, or when you supply information such as your address,
              phone number or credit card. We use the information that you
              provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,
              customizing future shopping for you, improving our website, and
              communicating with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you send us an email with a question or comment, we will write
              back using your email address, but we will not keep the address or
              use it again, unless you have a follow-up question. If you send us
              a message that is a lot of gibberish (assuming that it is your
              little one pounding the keyboard), we will laugh and possibly
              write back.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every computer has an IP (Internet Protocol) address. IP addresses
              of computers used to visit this site are noted. In addition, we
              automatically collect other information such as email addresses,
              browser types, operating systems, and the URL addresses of sites
              clicked to and from this site.
            </li>
            <li>
              No one will be excluded from our site for not giving us personal
              information. When we do ask for personal information (like an
              email address), we will only keep it until that particular
              activity is complete. We will not share this information with a
              third party.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not sell products or services to children. If you are under
              18, you may make a purchase only with the involvement of a parent
              or guardian.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other than in the places and for the purposes explicitly disclosed
              in this Privacy Policy, we do not knowingly collect any PI
              directly from Child Users under age 18.
            </li>
            <li>
              We work to protect the security of your information during
              transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
              encrypts information you input. We use encryption to protect your
              information contained in our customer list. We use a firewall to
              protect against unlawful intrusion. We limit access to your
              information on a “need to know” basis. We reveal only the last
              five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
              Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the
              appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is
              important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
              password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished
              using a shared computer. No system can guarantee absolute
              security, just as the finest lock can not guarantee physical
              security. However, we take every reasonable precaution to assure
              that your data is secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not ask for certain sensitive PI such as social security
              numbers, driver’s license numbers, or biometric data. However,
              paying subscribers are asked for payment information when they
              subscribe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because the security of your Personal Information is important to
              us, we only ask for PI where it serves a business purpose and try
              to limit the collection of PI to only what is necessary to
              accomplish those purposes. We also use commercially reasonable
              physical, technical, and administrative security measures designed
              to safeguard all information collected by the Services.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5 class="text-dark text-5">Cookies</h5>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files placed on your device to collect
            standard internet log information and visitor behavior information.
            The cookies may transmit information via your browser with a purpose
            of authenticating or identifying the computer (via, e.g., the IP
            address) or the User. Cookies may contain information such as
            registration data and User preferences. We use cookies to remember
            browser preferences, and improve our visitors’ experiences on the
            site. No personal information is ever stored in a KneeBouncer
            cookie, even if you have entered your name or email address on other
            parts of KneeBouncers. If you do not want the Services to collect
            information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser
            to reject cookies from the Services. Each browser is different, so
            you should check your browser’s Help menu to learn how to change
            your cookie preferences. However, please note that if you reject or
            block cookies from the Services, the Services may not function as
            intended. For example, you will not be able to remain logged into
            your Account, and therefore you would have to log in during each
            page transition. How We Use Information We will never monetize the
            Personal Information of any User of the Services by providing it to
            a third party in exchange for money, except as described in this
            policy in the context of a sale of the Company. We and our
            third-party service providers may use the information collected from
            Users as follows: User Information Information collected from Users
            may be used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To permit you to register and use the Services, including, for
              example, to send you communications.
            </li>
            <li>
              To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, retrieve
              your password, or provide technical support. For Consumer and
              Other Accounts to provide marketing communications that we believe
              may be of interest to you. While it is never our intention to send
              any marketing messages to children, if you believe a Child User
              has received such a marketing communication, please contact us.
              You can always choose to stop receiving these marketing messages
              by simply following the instructions contained in the message or,
              if the communication is by phone, informing the caller of your
              desire not to receive further phone communications.

              To deliver KneeBouncer advertising to you based on your visits to
              the non-child-directed portions of the Services (such as
              www.KneeBouncers.com), for example when you visit third-party
              websites and applications or via postal mail. We will never use
              information collected in the child-directed portions of the
              Services for targeted advertising purposes. We do not currently
              respond to web browser “do not track” signals due to lack of
              standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted;
              however, you may opt out of receiving online interest-based
              advertising from our interest-based advertising providers by
              visiting www.aboutads.info/choices. For more information about web
              browser “do not track” signals, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.

          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, with respect to Consumer and Other Accounts, we may use
            third-party advertising networks and other affiliates in association
            with cookies, pixel tags, or IFrames for Adult Users’ visits to the
            non-child-directed portions of the Services and to (1) deliver
            interest-based advertising to those Adult Users, including
            KneeBouncers-branded advertising, when those Adult Users visit
            third-party websites; and (2) provide us with statistics about the
            effectiveness of our advertising on third-party websites. These
            third-party advertising networks may use this cookie information in
            accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not disclose the
            Personal Information of any User to third parties for any marketing
            or promotional purposes. This also means that we do not share the
            Personal Information of children under the age of 16 for valuable
            consideration. We also may disclose de-identified and/or aggregated
            User information for any other purpose as permissible by applicable
            law—for example, the distribution of de-identified user records to
            outside researchers or the distribution of reports containing
            aggregate user demographic and traffic patterns—provided that no
            individual Adult User or Child User or any specific end-user device
            can be readily identified. California Privacy Rights Effective
            January 1, 2020, the CCPA provides California residents with
            specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section
            describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those
            rights. In this section “you” or “your” refers to California
            residents. Under the new law we are required to disclose the
            categories of sources from whom we collect personal information, and
            the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained
            above. We are also required to communicate information about rights
            you have under California law, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Right to access Personal Information. You may be entitled to
              receive the specific pieces of your Personal Information we hold.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to data portability. You may be entitled to receive a copy
              of your electronic Personal Information in a readily-usable
              format.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to disclosure. You may be entitled to receive information
              regarding the categories of Personal Information we collected, the
              sources from which we collected Personal Information, the purposes
              for which we collected and shared Personal Information, the
              categories of Personal Information that we sold and the categories
              of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold, and
              the categories of Personal Information that we disclosed for a
              business purpose in the 12 months preceding your request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to deletion. You may be entitled to request that we delete
              the Personal Information that we have collected from you. We will
              use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, in
              compliance with applicable laws. Please note, however, that we may
              need or be required to keep such information, such as for our
              legitimate business purposes or to comply with applicable law.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Right to opt-out of certain sharing with third parties. You may be
            entitled to direct us to stop disclosing your Personal Information
            to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. You
            can exercise such right to opt-out Do Not Sell My Personal
            Information. As stated in the Summary of Key Points above, we will
            never monetize the Personal Information of any User of the Services
            by providing it to a third party in exchange for money. The CCPA has
            a broader definition of the term “sell” which includes disclosing
            Personal Information to any third party for valuable consideration.
            When we work with our advertising partners we are disclosing certain
            information such as cookies for their services, which are of value
            to us. You may be entitled to direct us to stop disclosing your
            Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable
            consideration. You can exercise such right to opt-out Do Not Sell My
            Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we are required to provide you certain information
            about the business and commercial purposes for which we collect and
            share your personal information. We use and disclose the information
            we collect for the business purposes described in this policy,
            including but not limited to: process payments, conduct research,
            detect security incidents and prevent fraud, debug and repair
            errors, maintain your account, provide customer service, and other
            activities to improve our service, show advertising, market our
            services, and understand how users interact with our services. In
            the preceding 12 months, we have also disclosed the following
            categories of personal information for one or more business
            purposes: identifiers, commercial information, internet or
            electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and
            inferences we draw or derive about users.

            We use and disclose the information we collect for the following
            business purposes: enabling and affecting commercial transactions
            and advancing our commercial and economic interests, such as
            delivering interest-based advertising to Adult Users and analyzing
            the effectiveness of our advertisements. Only you or a person
            registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize
            to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
            related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable
            consumer request on behalf of your Child.
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal
            Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
            the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create
            an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided
            in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity
            or authority to make the request.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-dark text-5">Non-Discrimination</h5>
          <p>
            We fully support your privacy rights and will not discriminate
            against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-dark text-5">Links to Other Services</h5>
          <p>
            In certain sections of the Services, we may include links to
            external websites or applications (for example, Facebook and
            Twitter). However, in order to protect children from accessing these
            external websites, an Adult User will be required to enter a valid
            password. These websites and applications are governed by their own
            privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be
            substantially different from ours. We encourage you to review the
            privacy policies and information collection practices of any
            external websites and apps, as those parties’ practices would not be
            subject to this policy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-dark text-5">Location of Information Processing</h5>
          <p>
            The Services are controlled and operated by us from the United
            States. Your information may be stored and processed in any country
            where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers,
            including the United States, which may have data protection laws
            that are different from those of your country. In addition, your
            information may be subject to access requests from governments,
            courts, or law enforcement officials in countries where it may be
            processed, under the laws of those countries.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-dark text-5">Security</h5>
          <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to us, and we
            employ physical, technical, and administrative security measures
            designed to safeguard the information collected by the Services. We
            use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology)
            encryption to transfer PI. Other security safeguards include, but
            are not limited to, data encryption, firewalls, and physical access
            controls to buildings and files. Account holders create a password
            in the registration process. You can help protect against
            unauthorized access to your Account and PI by selecting and
            protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
            computer and browser by signing off after you have finished
            accessing your Account. At registration, we assign a Member ID to
            each Account and use those Member IDs to authenticate logins, allow
            access to the subscription content, and monitor compliance. The
            Member ID is also used to authenticate users when requesting
            technical support. Access to information is limited (through
            user/password credentials and two-factor authentication) to those
            employees who require it to perform their job functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes to Our Privacy Policy We constantly try to provide the best
            services, and accordingly our Privacy Policy will change from time
            to time. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by
            posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Services, and for certain
            revisions that materially expand the ways in which we use or share
            the information previously collected from you through the Services,
            either display an alert next to the Privacy Policy, display an alert
            upon login to the Services, or directly communicate with you (e.g.,
            via the email address associated with your Account).
          </p>

            If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, send us
