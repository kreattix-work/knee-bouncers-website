          <p>
            In these terms of use, we use the word “Submissions” to mean text,
            messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories,
            screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings,
            videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics),
            sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons’
            names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions,
            appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or
            material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post,
            upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute
            (collectively, “Distribute”) on or through a KneeBouncers’ Sit
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and
            Unsolicited Submissions. “Solicited Submissions” means those
            Submissions (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide
            to us via any feature or activity on a KneeBouncers’ Site for our
            review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or
            compensation (collectively, “Consideration”) (such as prizes or
            other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions); and (b)
            that you Distribute on or through any KneeBouncers’ Site for which
            you do not seek Consideration (such as in our Guest Services and in
            Public Forums (as defined below in Section 6, entitled “PUBLIC
            FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION”)). “Unsolicited Submissions” are any and
            all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of
            this paragraph.
          </p>
          <h6 class="text-5 text-dark mb-3">
            DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT.
          </h6>
          <p>
            Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or
            consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute
            Unsolicited Submissions on or through any KneeBouncers’ Sites. We
            want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when
            projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others
            to be similar to their own creative work. We therefore ask that you
            not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission. In any event, you agree
            that any Submissions you make is not being made in confidence or
            trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended
            or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no
            expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type
            (other than any stated Consideration).
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of
            these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and
            Solicited Submissions. Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors,
            agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled
            to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable
            to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or
            disclosure of any Submission.
          </p>
          <h6 class="text-5 text-dark mb-3">LICENSES AND REPRESENTATIONS</h6>
          <p>
            You hereby grant us and our licensees, distributors, agents,
            representatives and other authorized users, a non-exclusive,
            irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and
            transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license for an

            applicable law) under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade
            secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual and
            industrial property rights you own or control to use, reproduce,
            transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify
            (including removing lyrics and music from any Submission or

            and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all
            media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including
            on KneeBouncers’ Sites, on third party web sites, on our broadcast
            and cable networks and stations, on our broadband and wireless
            platforms, products and services, on physical media, and in

            limitation, entertainment, news, advertising, promotional,
            marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without
            further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the
            requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other
            person or entity (the “Submissions License”).
          </p>
          <p>
            By communicating a Submission, you represent and warrant that the
            Submission and your communication thereof conform to the Rules of
            Conduct (set forth below in Section 7 labeled “RULES OF CONDUCT”))
            and other requirements of these terms of use and that you own or
            have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions,
            without the need for any permission from or payment to any other
            person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such
            Submission in all manners contemplated by these terms of use
            (including the Submissions License). These terms of use (including
            the Submissions License) do not limit any past or future grant of
            rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have
            made or make with respect to Submissions. To the extent that any
            Submissions you Distribute on or through KneeBouncers’ Sites contain
            original songs or recordings, you hereby represent that you are a
            member of ASCAP, BMI, SESAC or other applicable mechanical,
            performing rights and/or copyright owners’ society and that all
            musical compositions (including lyrics) and sound recordings
            contained in such Submissions are available for licensing to us (and
            our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other
            authorized users) directly from such societies. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, regardless of whether you are a member of any rights
            society, you grant the Submissions License with respect to each and
            every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recordings
            contained in such Submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent that we solicit Submissions through features or
            activities on or through KneeBouncers’ Sites (including games,
            sweepstakes, contests, promotions, and Public Forums (defined below
            in Section 6, labeled “PUBLIC FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION”)) that
            require the use of our copyrighted works (in whole or in part), we
            hereby grant you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work
            using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) as required (but
            only as required, and only for the purpose of creating your
            Submissions); provided however, that such license shall be
            conditioned upon your assignment of all rights in the work you
            create to us. If such rights are not assigned to us, your license to
            create derivative works using our copyrighted works (in whole or in
            part) shall be null and void. You agree to the foregoing grant of
            rights, consents, agreements and assignments whether or not your
            Submissions are used by us.
          </p>
          <p>
            You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into
            and execute any document and/or do any act which might be necessary
            to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments
            and waivers set forth in these terms of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that any Submissions you make are not being made in
            confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary
            relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way,
            and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or
            consideration of any type.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent any “moral rights,” “ancillary rights,” or similar
            rights (“Moral Rights”) in or to the Submissions exist and are not
            exclusively owned by us and to the extent you are able to do so
            under applicable law, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to
            us or our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other
            authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to
            enforce from any others who may possess such rights. To the extent
            such an agreement is unenforceable, you hereby give a Moral Rights
            Consent. To the extent any other person has Moral Rights in or to
            the Submission, you must obtain a Moral Rights Consent from that
            person and provide it on request to KneeBouncers . “Moral Rights
            Consent” means a waiver of moral rights to the maximum extent
            permitted by applicable law and an unconditional consent to any act
            or omission in relation to the Submissions by or on behalf of
            KneeBouncers or any licensee or subsequent owner of copyright in the
            Submissions, including an act or omission which would, but for these
            terms of use, infringe your moral rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without limiting the scope of the Submissions License or any future
            grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments, and waivers you
            may make with respect to Submissions, and to the extent allowed by
            applicable law, you hereby ratify any prior grant of rights,
            consents, agreements, assignments and waivers made by you with
            respect to Submissions submitted by you to us.

            use. Any such amendment to these terms of use will be effective
            thirty (30) calendar days following either our dispatch of an e-mail

            delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the

          <h6 class="text-5 text-dark mb-3">TERMINATION</h6>
          <p>
            These terms of use are effective until terminated by either you or
            us. You may terminate these terms of use at any time by
            discontinuing use of the Site and destroying all materials obtained
            from the Site and all related documentation and all copies and
            installations thereof, whether made under these terms of use or
            otherwise. We may immediately terminate these terms of use with
            respect to you (including your access to the KNEEBOUNCERS’ SITES) in
            our absolute discretion including, without limitation, if you breach
            or fail to comply with any material term or provision of these terms
            of use. Upon termination, you must cease use of the Site and destroy
            all materials obtained from the Site and all copies thereof, whether
            made under these terms of use or otherwise. We have adopted and
            implemented a policy that provides for the termination, in
            appropriate circumstances, of the accounts of users who are repeat
            infringers of copyright. Any fraudulent, abusive or otherwise
            illegal activity may also be grounds for termination of your
            account, at our sole discretion, and you may be reported to
            appropriate law-enforcement agencies.

          <h6 class="text-5 text-dark mb-3">GENERAL PROVISIONS</h6>
          <p>
            Subject to the requirements of applicable consumer rights and other
            laws, these terms of use shall be governed by and construed in
            accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland and the laws of
            the United States, without giving effect to any principles of
            conflicts of law. If any provision of these terms of use shall be
            unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision
            shall be deemed severable from these terms of use and shall not
            affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
            These terms of use take effect as an agreement and separately as a
            notice which limits the basis on which KneeBouncers makes the
            KneeBouncers’ Sites available. No waiver of any provision of these
            terms of use by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
            such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any
            right or provision under these terms of use shall not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision. In these terms of use, the word
            “including” is used illustratively, as if followed by the words “but
            not limited to.” TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU
            AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR
            RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY KneeBouncers’ Site MUST
            COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR (OR THE MINIMUM APPLICABLE STATUTORY
            PERIOD, IF LONGER) AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE,
            SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED. Supply of goods,
            services and software through KneeBouncers’ Sites is subject to
            United States export control and economic sanctions requirements. By
            acquiring any such items through KneeBouncers’ Sites, you represent
            and warrant that your acquisition comports with and your use of the
            item will comport with those requirements. Without limiting the
            foregoing, you may not acquire goods, services or software through
            KneeBouncers’ Sites if: 1) you are in, under the control of, or a
            national or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria or
            if you are on the United States of America Treasury Department’s
            Specially Designated Nationals List or the United States of America
            Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List, Unverified List or Entity
            List or 2) you intend to supply the acquired goods, services or
            software to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria (or a national
            or resident of one of these countries) or to a person on the
            Specially Designated Nationals List, Denied Persons List, Unverified
            List or Entity List.

            CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
          </h6>
          <p>
            We have adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the
            termination, in appropriate circumstances as determined by us in our
            sole discretion, of users who are infringers of copyright.
            Notifications of claimed copyright infringement must be sent to
            Service Provider’s Designated Agent. To be effective, the
            notification must be a written communication that includes the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A physical or electronic signature of person authorized to act on
              behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
              infringed;
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
              infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
              site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
              of such works at that site;
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
              to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed
              or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
              sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
            </li>
            <li>
              Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the
              complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
              available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining
              party may be contacted;
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief
              that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
              authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
              and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is
              authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
              that is allegedly infringed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may give you notice that we have removed or disabled access to
            certain material by means of a general notice on any KneeBouncers’
            Site, electronic mail to a user’s e-mail address in our records, or
            by written communication sent by first-class mail to your physical
            address in our records. If you receive such a notice, you may
            provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent that
            includes the information below. To be effective, the
            counter-notification must be a written communication that includes
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
            <li>
              Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
              access has been disabled, and the location at which the material
              appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement from you under the penalty of perjury, that you have a
              good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a
              result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be
              removed or disabled; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement
              that you consent to the jurisdiction of a court for the judicial
              district in which your physical address is located, or if your
              physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial
              district in which KneeBouncers may be found, and that you will
              accept service of process from the person who provided
              notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such
              person.
